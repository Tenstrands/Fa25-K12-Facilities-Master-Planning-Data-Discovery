Facility Master Plan (FMP) Scoring Rubric
1. Facility Inventory & Condition Assessment

Goal: Inventory and assess all district facilities—schools, admin buildings, and properties—so that their condition can inform long-term planning.

Key Elements

Building age, size, and type (including portables)

Classroom details (square footage, characteristics)

Specialized spaces (labs, CTE, athletics, multipurpose, cafeterias, libraries)

Comprehensive condition assessment beyond major issues

Scoring

1 – No mention/minimal: Missing sites; only major deficiencies listed; no system-level data; no link to learning conditions.

2 – Limited: Basic inventory (counts, portables) but little detail; FIT-only assessment; minimal system or non-classroom coverage.

3 – Sufficient: Reasonably detailed inventory with building sizes, ages, and systems; uses a tool beyond FIT; links condition to learning (air quality, comfort, access).

4 – Significant: Comprehensive, district-wide inventory with site plans and square footage; robust assessment across all systems using multiple data sources; connects condition data to outcomes and integrates lifecycle planning.

2. Enrollment & Capacity Planning

Goal: Use demographic and enrollment projections to guide long-range planning and facility use.

Scoring

1 – No mention: No projections or demographic analysis; ignores capacity issues.

2 – Limited: Short-term projections (≤ 5 yrs) with little data; superficial capacity discussion; no link to projects or consolidation.

3 – Sufficient: 5–10 yr projections with methods explained; identifies over/under-utilized sites; discusses closures, consolidations, or new construction.

4 – Significant: Comprehensive analysis tied to demographics and housing; detailed site-level capacity data; clear linkage of projections to facility actions; explores adaptive and community uses; aligns trends with capital strategy.

3. Educational Alignment

Goal: Demonstrate how facilities support the district’s educational mission, goals, and programmatic needs.

Scoring

1 – No mention: Ignores educational goals and specs; no link between projects and instruction.

2 – Limited: Mentions goals generically; basic minimum specs; brief program references without detail.

3 – Sufficient: Connects mission/goals to facilities; includes detailed specs (STEM labs, flexible spaces); links projects to programs; partial coverage of future needs.

4 – Significant: Makes educational alignment the organizing principle; integrates mission, instruction, and design; analyzes how facilities support multiple programs (TK, CTE, SPED, tech); plans for adaptability and evolving pedagogy.

4. Outdoor Spaces & Campus Greening

Goal: Evaluate and plan for sustainable, health-promoting outdoor environments and greening initiatives.

Scoring

1 – No mention: No discussion of outdoor space or greening; only athletic/play areas shown.

2 – Limited: Mentions fields/playgrounds but little data; minimal or passing reference to shade/greening; no connection to health or access.

3 – Sufficient: Provides data on outdoor surfaces, canopy, or ratios; identifies improvement strategies (shade, gardens, landscaping); partial links to wellness or learning.

4 – Significant: Treats greening as central; includes district-wide data and mapping; multiple strategies (tree cover, permeable surfaces, outdoor classrooms, bioswales); connects greening to resilience, wellness, and community benefit.

5. Climate Risk & Mitigation (0–4 Scale)

Goal: Assess climate risks (heat, drought, fire, floods, etc.) and integrate resilience strategies.

Scoring

0 – None: No reference to climate risks or readiness.

1 – Minimal: Acknowledges climate broadly but lacks detail or data; may list generic strategies.

2 – Limited: Includes either (A) a detailed look at one climate impact + strategy, or (B) shows climate readiness as a design theme.

3 – Sufficient: Includes both detailed analysis of ≥ 1 risk + strategy and positions climate resilience as a recurring theme.

4 – Significant: Makes climate readiness central across the entire plan; conducts comprehensive multi-risk assessment; details district-wide and site-specific strategies for long-term resilience.

6. Energy Efficiency & Resilience

Goal: Modernize for decarbonization, electrification, energy security, and alignment with California climate goals (Title 24, ZNE).

Scoring

1 – No mention: No discussion of energy, resilience, or state requirements.

2 – Limited: Mentions upgrades (solar, LEDs, HVAC) without data or strategy; omits resilience/electrification context.

3 – Sufficient: Provides energy data and some strategies; partial coverage of electrification or microgrids; incomplete compliance plan.

4 – Significant: Embeds energy resilience and decarbonization in the vision; presents baselines, targets, and costs; cites Title 24 / ZNE; details electrification, renewables, and microgrid strategies; connects energy systems to cost, emissions, and climate disruption resilience.

7. Financial Plan & Capital Strategy

Goal: Provide a realistic, prioritized, and sustainable financial roadmap for facility investments.

Scoring

1 – No mention: No funding strategy, cost estimates, or prioritization framework.

2 – Limited: Lists project costs or funding sources superficially; lacks methods or rationale; no risk or maintenance discussion.

3 – Sufficient: Itemized or category-level estimates; outlines prioritization (e.g., safety → modernization → expansion); identifies funding sources; acknowledges fiscal constraints; partial coverage of lifecycle costs.

4 – Significant: Full capital strategy integrating estimating, prioritization, and funding; detailed cost methods and contingencies; clear criteria (safety, equity, lifecycle); multiple funding mechanisms (bonds, grants, fees, partnerships); considers long-term sustainability and debt capacity; aligns finances with educational and facility priorities.
